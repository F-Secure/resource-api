Resource API is a framework that allows developers declaratively define resources and relationships between each other.
The framework maintains `referential integrity <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity>`_ for all relations
and resources. The integrity is maintained regardless of data storage model.

Also the framework provides means to expose HTTP interface to the resources via a simple JSON document.
